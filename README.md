# BeanKeeper - Task Management Tool for Parents with Newborns


## Mission 

Celebrating the arrival of a newborn to the family comes with some unknown challenges. Facing a significant increase in the workload, parents often struggle to balance their new responsibilities with managing their regular tasks, leading to stress and exhaustion. 

Our goal is to create an application that can help parents nurture not only their newborn but also the relationship between themselves in facing those challenges and hurdles.


## Approach

This is a `React` Application oriented around a gamified appraoch of raising beans as a simile of raising the newborn. The key features were deisgned to help parents with their time management as well as coding with parental stress. What makes our application unique is the bounding features for each parents to better communicate and support each other while raising the baby.
